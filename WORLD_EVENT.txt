The new additions we made to the virtual world is a cloud event.
When mouse pressed, a group of clouds and an "evil cloud" will appear.
The evil cloud moves toward the nearest dude and turns them into a zombie.
If fairy moves close to the normal clouds, it turns into a bee.
The bee moves toward the nearest tree stump and turns it into a Christmas tree.
