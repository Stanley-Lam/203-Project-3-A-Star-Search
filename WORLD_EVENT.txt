The new additions we made to the virtual world is a cloud event.
When mouse pressed, a group of clouds and an "evil cloud" will appear.
The evil cloud moves toward the nearest dude and turns them into a zombie.
If fairy moves close to the normal clouds, it turns into a bee.
The bee moves toward the nearest tree stump and turns it into a Christmas tree.

Project Members:
Stanley: Imported all the new entity image files and programmed the events to occur.
Aarav: Worked on making the bee class with the functions moveTo and execute activity
as well as create the transform function for fairy and dude
Josh: Worked on making the evil cloud move towards entities of the dude class and
transforming the dude class so that when the evil cloud comes near it,
it transforms into a zombie.
